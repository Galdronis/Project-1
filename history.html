    <h1>Columbus</h1>

    <h2 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Early History</h2>
    <p class="col align-self-start">Columbus has a rich history starting long before its incorporation in 1816. As far back as 1000 B.C., the area that would become Columbus was inhabited by various indigenous peoples known as the Mound Builders. The most significant of their living structures is the burial mounds that can still be found in Columbus today!</p>

    <p>In the conclusion of the Seven Years' War, the territory where Columbus would be built was ceded to the british empire, paving the way for the eventual western settling of the area.</p>
    
    <h2 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Founding and Incorporation</h2>

    <p>Upon achieving statehood, there was significant disagreement about exactly where the capitol should be. The main contenders initially were Chillicothe and Zanesville. Influential politicians argued for many years until finally settling on building a new city. A centralized city near to the most efficient transportation routes of the time: rivers! Upon its founding in 1812, it was simply dense forest land that was traditionally used for hunting. Over the next four years, the land would be cleared to make way for the eventual incorporation that would come in 1816. </p>

    <h2 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Trials and Creation of a City</h2>

    <p>Following its incorporation, things were not easy. Living conditions were extremely poor courtesy of the frequently flooding river. Malaria was rampant and a full on cholera outbreak occurred in 1833, leading to the death of at least 100 of the 3000 people living there at the time. Throughout these difficulties, the city continued to grow and was officially chartered the following year as the city of Columbus, Ohio! Expansion picked up over the next 25 years as Columbus annexed the city of Franklinton and the Colombus and Xenia Railroad became the first railroad into the city. Meanwhile at a railroad of the more underground type, things were thriving. With the help of James Preston Poindexter, the city became a safe place for runaway slaves. By the end of the 19th century, Columbus had become a hub for manufacturing.</p>

    <h2 class="d-flex justify-content-center">the 20th century</h2>

    <p>Known for the distinct arches in much of the architecture, Columbus had become known as "The Arch City." In 1913, the Great Flood of 1913 would devastate where franklinton was, leaving ninety dead and thousands homeless. Over the next few years, rebuilding and prevention efforts would occur. During the roaring 20s, there was a massive construction boom in the city, leading to the building of The Ohio Theatre and a handful of other buildings that would be improved on over the decades. The city's diverse economy helped to shield it from the Great Depression, and World War 2 led to a population boom due to the thriving economy. When the interstate highway system began to materialize, Columbus' suburban areas grew enormously, and by the 1990s, Columbus was Ohio's largest city in both land area and population.</p>
